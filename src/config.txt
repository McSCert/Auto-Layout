#SHOW_NAMES Indicates whether or not to show block names in the final layout. 
#Default is no-change.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	no-change (blocks will show or not show their name just as they did in the 
#		initial layout), 
#	all (all blocks will show their name),
#	none (no blocks will show their name)
show_names: no-change

#PORTLESS_RULE Indicates the rule by which blocks with no ports will be 
#	placed in the final layout.
#Default bottom.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	bottom (blocks will be placed along the bottom side of the system),
#	top (blocks will be placed along the top side of the system),
#	left (blocks will be placed along the left side of the system),
#	right (blocks will be placed along the right side of the system),
#	same_half_vertical (blocks will be placed along the bottom/top side of
#		the system according to which half they started in),
#	same_half_horizontal (blocks will be placed along the left/right side
#		of the system according to which half they started in)
portless_rule: same_half_vertical

#SORT_PORTLESS Indicates the rule by which blocks with no ports will be 
#	grouped within the placement designated by PORTLESS_RULE in the final
#	layout.
#Default blocktype.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	blocktype	(blocks will be grouped by their block type)
#	none		(no means of grouping is used)
portless_rule: blocktype

#INPORT_RULE Indicates the rule by which inport blocks will be placed in
#	the final layout.
#Default none.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	left_align (Inports will be aligned along the left bound of the system
#		unless there are obstructions, similar idea to aligning text in 
#		Word),
#	none (no special rule is used)
inport_rule: left_align

#OUTPORT_RULE Indicates the rule by which outport blocks will be placed in
#	the final layout.
#Default none.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	right_align (Outports will be aligned along the right bound of the
#		system unless there are obstructions, similar idea to aligning text
#		in Word),
#	none (no special rule is used)
outport_rule: right_align

#NOTE_RULE Indicates the rule by which annotations will be placed in the
#	the final layout.
#Default on-right.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	on-right (annotations are moved to the right side of the system to be 
#		found easily),
#	none (annotations aren't moved by the tool at all)
outport_rule: on-right

#*****NOT CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED*****
#BLOCK_SIZING Indicates the rule by which blocks resized for the final layout.
#Default fit_text.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	ignore
#	no-change (blocks will be left at their starting size)
#	min_fit_text (smallest size to fit text within the block)
#	fit_text (slightly larger than min_fit_text to better ensure the block is wide enough for the text)
#	min_for_ports (smallest height to fit the block's ports)
#	for_connected_blocks (resize vertically to better line up with blocks that connect to it)
#	extra_space (large enough to allow extra space for each factor)
