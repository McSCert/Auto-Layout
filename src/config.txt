#GRAPHING_ALG Determines which graphing algorithm will be used for the initial
#	layout. The chosen algorithm determines locations for nodes (blocks) in a 
#	graph (Simulink diagram).
#Default is auto
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	digraph		(MATLAB graphing algorithm introduced in R2015b)
#	graphviz	(3rd party graphing algorithm which requires separate download)
#	auto		(digraph if the MATLAB version is R2015b or above, else graphviz)
graphing_alg: auto

#SHOW_NAMES Indicates whether or not to show block names in the final layout. 
#Default is no-change.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	no-change	(blocks will show or not show their name just as they did in the 
#				initial layout), 
#	all 		(all blocks will show their name),
#	none 		(no blocks will show their name)
show_names: no-change

#PORTLESS_RULE Indicates the rule by which blocks with no ports will be 
#	placed in the final layout.
#Default bottom.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	bottom (blocks will be placed along the bottom side of the system),
#	top (blocks will be placed along the top side of the system),
#	left (blocks will be placed along the left side of the system),
#	right (blocks will be placed along the right side of the system),
#	same_half_vertical (blocks will be placed along the bottom/top side of
#		the system according to which half they started in),
#	same_half_horizontal (blocks will be placed along the left/right side
#		of the system according to which half they started in)
portless_rule: bottom

#SORT_PORTLESS Indicates the rule by which blocks with no ports will be 
#	grouped within the placement designated by PORTLESS_RULE in the final
#	layout.
#Default blocktype.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	blocktype			(blocks will be grouped by their BlockType parameter)
#	masktype_blocktype	(blocks will be grouped for each unique MaskType-BlockType pair)
#	none				(no means of grouping is used)
sort_portless: blocktype

#INPORT_RULE Indicates the rule by which inport blocks will be placed in
#	the final layout.
#Default none.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	left_align (Inports will be aligned along the left bound of the system
#		unless there are obstructions, similar idea to aligning text in 
#		Word),
#	none (no special rule is used)
inport_rule: left_align

#OUTPORT_RULE Indicates the rule by which outport blocks will be placed in
#	the final layout.
#Default none.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	right_align (Outports will be aligned along the right bound of the
#		system unless there are obstructions, similar idea to aligning text
#		in Word),
#	none (no special rule is used)
outport_rule: right_align

#NOTE_RULE Indicates the rule by which annotations will be placed in the
#	the final layout.
#Default on-right.
#
#Acceptable parameter values are:
#	on-right (annotations are moved to the right side of the system to be 
#		found easily),
#	none (annotations aren't moved by the tool at all)
note_rule: on-right
